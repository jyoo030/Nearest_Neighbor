# Nearest_Neighbor
To run the program, open a terminal and enter python, then enter the name of the .py file (nearest_neighbor.py) and put the filename right after.
For example, if the file containing your data is "input.txt", then you would put python nearest_neighbor.py input.txt. 
This will output a file that is titled "input_distance.txt" with the answer. It will always be the original filename_distance.
